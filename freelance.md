# Independent Applied AI Research - Freelance

With Code From Anywhere I run an applied AI Research Lab that is for hire. Do you want to work with me?

What I can do for you:

- I can do experimental work in [areas that interest me](https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere) and benefit you and create proofs of concept.
- I can improve my [open source work](https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere) in areas that benefit you.
- You can buy my [private IP](https://github.actionschema.com/CodeFromAnywere) or licence it.
- You can get a high-scale access and uptime SLA for my APIs.

Here are my rules:

- All my work is shared IP meaning I also have all rights to it, including selling to your competitors or open sourcing.
- I don't work within your codebase. I interface with OpenAPIs at most. I deliver modular, documented code of the requested quality level. My stack: Serverless Typescript, OpenAPI, Github.
- You don't get to micro-manage my implementation or way of working.
- I work alone or with my own team, don't expect me to report to you or your team daily.
- All my invoices are pay-what-you-want, you pay me what you think I deserve. You want the work to go faster? Pay more. You pay less than expected? Expect the work to go slower or stop.

Still want to work with me? Or do you want a demo for something? [Reach out](https://cal.com/karsens)
