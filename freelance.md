# Independent Applied AI Research - Freelance

With Code From Anywhere I run an applied AI Research Lab that is for hire. Do you want to work with me?

Why work with me?

- Cutting-edge AI expertise applied to your specific challenges
- Flexible, modular solutions that integrate seamlessly with your systems
- Rapid prototyping and proof-of-concept development
- Access to a wealth of open-source and proprietary IP
- No long-term commitments - pay for value received

What I can do for you:

- I can do experimental work in [areas that interest me](https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere) and benefit you and create proofs of concept.
- I can improve my [open source work](https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere) in areas that benefit you.
- You can buy my [private IP](https://github.actionschema.com/CodeFromAnywhere) or licence it.
- You can get a high-scale access and uptime SLA for my APIs.

Here are my rules:

- All my work is shared IP meaning I also have all rights to it, including selling to your competitors or open sourcing.
- By focusing on OpenAPI interfaces, I deliver modular solutions that seamlessly integrate with your existing systems without disrupting your codebase. My stack: Serverless Typescript, OpenAPI, Github.
- I thrive on autonomy and deliver best results when given creative freedom in implementation.
- I work alone or with my own team, don't expect me to report to you or your team daily.
- I operate on a value-based pricing model. You determine the payment based on the value you receive. This approach ensures our incentives are aligned - higher compensation drives faster, more comprehensive results. I'm happy to discuss benchmarks or provide examples to help guide your decision.
